# Autonomous Driving Simulation

A 3D simulation environment for developing and testing autonomous driving algorithms.

## Features
- 3D visualization of road environments
- Multiple vehicle and object types (cars, trucks, cyclists, pedestrians)
- Color-coded object classification
- Customizable traffic scenarios
- Sensor simulation (LiDAR, cameras)

## Setup

- pip

### Installation
1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the simulation
```
python src/main.py
```
